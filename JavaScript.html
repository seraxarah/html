            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make wepages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browser support it without the need for plug-ins by means og built-in JavaScript engine.
